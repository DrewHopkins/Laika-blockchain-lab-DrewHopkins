Interact with the laika blackchain lab and give feedback.
The laika blackchain hopes to create a ui for smart contract dev without coding

I was very satisfied when I noticed the ability to switch on dark mode. The UI is extremely clean, so it was very easy to use. I also read some other feedback to see the general consensus of the app, and it seems that everyone mentions the similarity to Postman which I agree with. 

One caveat I may add is to have a module or textbox display that says connect to metamask and the rinkeby network, so that you may enable the Send button.
